# predicting-the-next-days-Open-stock-price
The primary aim was to predict the next day's 'Open' stock price for the S&P 500 index using historical data. The project also included trend analysis and feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
Conclusion:
The Random Forest model was able to capture the overall trend in the stock prices but may require further fine-tuning for more accurate predictions. The XGBoost model could potentially improve performance but needs to be explored further.
